# Data UI Demo - Portfolio Project

## High Priority - AI Integration (Main Portfolio Focus)
- [ ] Implement AI-powered data operations
  - Add AI query interface for natural language commands
  - Enable complex multi-step operations:
    - Data gathering from reliable sources
    - Data filtering and transformation
    - Automatic chart type selection based on data nature
    - Smart widget placement in layout
  - Support compound visualization requests:
    - Multiple charts from same dataset
    - Automatic layout optimization for related charts
    - Smart color palette selection across charts
  - Example complex queries support:
    - "Find top 10 countries by population, include crime rates and GDP"
    - "Create pie chart for crime rates and bar chart for population"
    - "Arrange charts in optimal layout for comparison"
  - Add explanation capability:
    - Data source citations
    - Why specific chart types were chosen
    - Insights about the data relationships
  - Implement progressive execution:
    - Show intermediate results while gathering data
    - Allow user to adjust/refine the request
    - Support follow-up questions and modifications
  - Portfolio showcase features:
    - Demo scenarios with impressive data analysis
    - Example of modern AI integration in business tools
    - Demonstration of complex system architecture
